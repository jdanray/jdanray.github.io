<p>I have always liked dynamic programming. I went on a kick recently where I wrote solutions to several classic dynamic programming problems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/weighted-job-scheduling-log-n-time/">GeeksforGeeks published my implementation of the weighed interval scheduling problem</a>. I wrote <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/dp/weighted_interval_scheduling.py">a Python program</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/dp/WeightedIntervalScheduling.java">a Java program</a> to solve <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shuchi/courses/787-F09/scribe-notes/lec3.pdf">the weighted interval scheduling problem</a>. When I was researching the problem, I noticed that <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/weighted-job-scheduling/">the solution on GeeksforGeeks</a> ran in O(n ^ 2) time, but I knew that the problem can be solved in O(n log n) time. So, I submitted a modification, and <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks</a> accepted it.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/dp/discrete_knapsack.py">Here are my implementations</a> of several solutions to <a href="http://oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu/~razvan/courses/cs4040/lecture16.pdf">the discrete knapsack problem</a>. I wrote a naive recursive solution, a memoized recursive solution, and a bottom-up dynamic programming solution.</p>

<p>I also implemented <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/dp/lcs.py">a naive recursive solution, a memoized recursive solution, and a bottom-up dynamic programming solution</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem">the longest common subsequence problem</a>.</p>

<p><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, shows the optimal way to cut up a rod whose pieces you want to sell, and <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/dp/rod_cut.py">I implemented their solution in Python</a>.</p>

<p>I implemented <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/dp/lis.py">a bottom-up dynamic programming solution</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence">the longest increasing subsequence problem</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/dp/fibonacci.py">Here are my implementations</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">the Fibonacci sequence</a>. Again I wrote a naive recursive solution, a memoized recursive solution, and a bottom-up dynamic programming solution.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/dp/choose.py">Here are my implementations</a> of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Combination.html">combination</a>. I wrote a naive recursive solution, a memoized recursive solution, and a bottom-up dynamic programming solution.</p>
