<p>Say that, if the characters of X appear in Y in the same order that they appear in X, then X is hidden in Y.</p> 

<p>So, if X is "ABC" and Y is "HAPPYBIRTHDAYCACEY", then X is hidden in Y. However, if X is "ABC" and Y is "TRAGICBIRTHDAYCACEY", then X is not hidden in Y, because "C" appears before "B" in "TRAGICBIRTHDAYCACEY". Of course, if X is "ABC" and Y is "HAPPYBIRTHDAY", then X is not hidden in Y, because "C" never appears in "HAPPYBIRTHDAY".</p>

<p>Now, given two strings X and Y, decide whether X is hidden in Y.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.icpc-midcentral.us/">the ACM-ICPC's 2015 Mid-Central USA Programming Contest</a>, this problem appeared in the guise of deciding whether a given password is hidden inside a given message. My solution to the problem is recursive:</p>

<p>
1) If X is empty, then it is vacuously true that X is hidden in Y.<br />
2) If X is nonempty and Y is empty, then it is false that X is hidden in Y.<br />
3) If the first character of X and the first character of Y are the same, then continue the procedure on the rest of X and the rest of Y.<br />
4) If the first character of X and the first character of Y are different, but the first character of Y appears somewhere else in X, then it is false that X is hidden in Y.<br />
5) If none of the above conditions obtains, then continue the procedure on X and the rest of Y.
