<p>This week <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/">/r/DailyProgrammer</a> posed a series of challenges related to graph theory.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4ijtrt/20160509_challenge_266_easy_basic_graph/">The first challenge</a> gives you the number of vertices of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UndirectedGraph.html">an undirected graph</a> and the graph's edges. It asks you to find the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/VertexDegree.html">degree of each vertex</a>. The bonus challenge asks you to construct <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AdjacencyMatrix.html">the adjacency matrix</a> of the graph. I solved both problems, and I combined my solutions into one solution. </p>

<p>Each vertex i corresponds to a row in the adjacency matrix. For each column j in the matrix, if there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j, then the matrix entry i,j is equal to 1, and 0 otherwise. So, to find the number of edges for a vertex in an undirected graph, you can just construct the adjacency matrix and then sum all of the entries of the corresponding row.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/graph_week/vertex_degree.py">My solution to both challenges</a> is up at <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code">my GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4iut1x/20160511_challenge_266_intermediate_graph_radius/">The next challenge</a> gives you the edges of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DirectedGraph.html">a directed graph</a>. It asks you to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_(graph_theory)#Related_concepts">the radius and the diameter of the graph</a>.</p>

<p>The eccentricity of a vertex is the greatest distance from that vertex to any other vertex. So, to find the radius and the diameter of a graph, you can find the eccentricity of each vertex. Then the radius is the smallest eccentricity, and the diameter is the largest eccentricity.</p>

<p>Because I find the eccentricity of each vertex, I find the distances between all pairs of vertices in the graph. So, my first thought was to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm">the Floyd-Warshall algorithm</a>. However, one of the given graphs has a cycle, and I mistakenly believed that Floyd-Warshall only applies to <a href="toposort.html">directed acyclic graphs</a>. So, instead of using Floyd-Warshall, I designed a solution around <a href="bfs.html">breadth-first search</a>. When I discovered that Floyd-Warshall only fails on graphs that have <i>negative cycles</i>, I implemented a solution that employs Floyd-Warshall.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/graph_week/graph_size_fw.py">Here</a> is my Floyd-Warshall solution. <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/graph_week/graph_size_bfs.py">Here</a> is my breadth-first search solution. Both are up at <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code">my GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4j65ls/20160513_challenge_266_hard_finding_friends_in/">The last challenge posed by /r/DailyProgrammer</a> gives you the number of vertices in an undirected graph and the graph's edges. It asks you to find <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaximumClique.html">a maximum clique</a> in the graph.</p>

<p>Even though the challenge is advertised as hard, I found it to be very easy. You can just recursively construct cliques and determine whether they are maximum. Although this is an <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExhaustiveSearch.html">exhaustive search</a>, you can't really solve the problem any faster than that, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem#NP-completeness">the maximum clique problem is NP-complete</a>. Fortunately, the size of the given problem instance is small enough for brute force to quickly yield a solution.</p>
