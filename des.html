<p>I implemented a simplified version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard">the Data Encryption Standard</a>. William Stallings presents the specification for this particular version of the DES in an appendix to his <em>Cryptography and Network Security</em>. In this version, the plaintext and ciphertext are only 8 bits, the key is only 10 bits, there are only two S-boxes, and there are only two Feistel rounds.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/crypto/sdes.py">My implementation</a> is up at <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/">my GitHub</a>.</p>
