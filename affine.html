<p>A <em>cipher</em> is an algorithm that turns a plaintext message into a coded message.</p>

<p>To obtain a coded message, a <em>shift cipher</em> shifts the letters in the plaintext message by an amount <em>b</em>.  For example, let b  = 3. Then, if we encrypt ‘HI’, we get ‘KL’.</p>

<p>To encode a letter like ‘Z’, we wrap back around the alphabet. So, if we encrypt ‘ZAY’, we get ‘CDB’.</p>

<p>The English alphabet permits only 26 shift ciphers, including the cipher in which the plaintext message is identical to the coded message. Consequently, to crack a shift cipher, an attacker only has to try at most 26 possibilities.</p>

<p>To obtain a coded message, a <em>substitution cipher</em> substitutes the letters in the plaintext message with letters in one or more ciphertext alphabets. A shift cipher is a type of substitution cipher. When you shift the letters in the plaintext message by <em>b</em>, you substitute them with letters that are <em>b</em> letters away.</p>

<p>We can match the letters of the alphabet with the integers 0 through 25, such that ‘A’ = 0, ‘B’ = 1, …, ‘Z’ = 25. Once we do that, a shift cipher essentially adds <em>b</em> and works modulo 26. So, for any given letter in a plaintext message, the numerical value of the corresponding letter in the coded message is given by</p>

<p>(x + b) mod m</p>

<p>where <em>x</em> is the integer that corresponds to the letter in the plaintext message, <em>b</em> is the secret key, and <em>m</em> is the number of letters in the alphabet.</p>

<p>An <em>affine cipher</em> is a generalization of the shift cipher that multiplies as well as adds. For any given letter in a plaintext message, the numerical value of the corresponding letter in the coded message is given by</p>

<p>(a * x + b) mod m</p>

<p>where <em>x</em> is the integer that corresponds to the letter in the plaintext message, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are the secret key, and <em>m</em> is the number of letters in the alphabet. So, a shift cipher is an affine cipher where a = 1.</p>

<p>To decrypt the coded message, we simply reverse the operations. So, for any given letter in a coded message, the numerical value of the corresponding letter in the plaintext message is given by</p>

<p>(a ^ -1) * (c – b) mod m</p>

<p>where <em>c</em> is the integer that corresponds to the letter in the coded message, and a ^ -1 is the modular multiplicative inverse of <em>a</em>. (That is, a ^ -1 is the number such that a * (a ^ -1) = 1 mod m.)</p>

<p>If <em>a</em> and <em>m</em> have a common factor other than 1, then there is more than one number that can be multiplied by <em>a</em> to get 1 modulo <em>m</em>. So, <em>a</em> and <em>m</em> must be relatively prime.</p>
