<p>Recently I manually backed up files to a USB drive. During that extremely pleasant experience, I decided that I'm going to automate the process for the future.</p>

<p>Backing up files by hand is time-consuming, error-prone, tedious, and stressful. So, I created a little bash script that will do the work for me.</p>
