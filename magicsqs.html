<p>I solved <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4dccix/20160404_challenge_261_easy_verifying_3x3_magic/">today's /r/DailyProgrammer challenge</a>. The challenge is easy, but both of the optional bonus problems are significantly more difficult, and I solved both of them.</p>

<p>The first bonus problem is to decide whether any given grid of integers forms <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MagicSquare.html">a magic square</a>. The second bonus problem is, given a grid whose bottom row is missing, to decide whether the given grid could possibly form a magic square.</p>

<p>I put <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/problems/magic_square.py">my code</a> up on <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/">my GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>EDIT (4/11/2016):</p>

<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/">John D. Cook's blog</a>, and I read that <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2016/04/05/magic-square-rows-and-columns-as-numbers/">all 3 x 3 magic squares have an interesting property</a>. Being both curious and skeptical, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/problems/three_squares_test.py">a little Python program</a> to see for myself whether it's true that they really do. The code is up at <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/">my GitHub</a>.</p>
