<div>From <em><span class="st"> GÃ¶del</span>, Escher, Bach</em>, by Douglas Hofstadter:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>In the Introduction, the word "isomorphism" was defined as an information-preserving transformation. We can now go into that notion a little more deeply, and see it from another perspective. The word "isomorphism" applies when two complex structures can be mapped onto each other, in such a way that to each part of one structure there is a corresponding part in the other structure, where "corresponding" means that the two parts play similar roles in their respective structures.</div></blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>A final word on the perception of isomorphisms: since they come in many shapes and sizes, figuratively speaking, it is not always totally clear when you really have found an isomorphism. Thus, "isomorphism" is a word with all the usual vagueness of words--which is a defect but an advantage as well.</blockquote>
