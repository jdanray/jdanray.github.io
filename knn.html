<p>The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a simple machine-learning algorithm that classifies a new data point according to the classes of the data points closest to it. An example should illustrate the nature and effectiveness of the algorithm.</p>

<p>Consider a given apartment renter. If three out of the five renters living nearest to our renter make >$75k/yr, then our renter probably makes >$75k/yr, too. Of course, it's possible that he or she doesn't, but it's likely that he or she does. The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm operates on this principle. Given an integer <em>k</em>, the algorithm classifies a new data point as the class that appears most frequently among the <em>k</em> data points nearest to the new data point<em>.</em></p>

<p>As <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2013/04/04/k-nearest-neighbors-dangerously-simple/">this great blog post</a> explains, it's crucial to pick an appropriate metric for measuring the nearness of neighbors. In my implementation, I used a common metric, the Euclidean distance.</p>
