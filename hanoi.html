<p>I've had <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/problems/hanoi.lisp">a solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem</a>, written in Common Lisp, on <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/">my GitHub</a> for a while now.</p>

<p>I would like to explain the Towers of Hanoi problem here. Unfortunately, it's difficult to explain if you don't use visual illustrations, and WordPress isn't great for visual illustrations. Consequently, I recommend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">the Wikipedia page</a>. But, to put the solution into a nutshell, the basic idea behind the algorithm is this:</p>

<p>If you have N rings on the source tower, then move the top N - 1 rings from the source tower to the spare tower. Then move the bottom Nth ring from the source tower to the destination tower in one move. Then move the N - 1 rings on the spare tower to the destination tower.</p>

<p>To move the N - 1 rings, you solve a subinstance of the original problem of size N - 1. So, it is natural to apply recursion.</p>
