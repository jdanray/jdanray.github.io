<p>In a previous post, I gave <a href="pnp.html">an informal explanation of the P=NP? problem</a>. In that post, I described both deterministic and nondeterministic Turing machines. A couple of months ago, <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/turing/tm.py">I decided to implement the deterministic Turing machine in Python</a>.</p>

<p>I also implemented <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/turing/div4.py">a special deterministic Turing machine that decides whether a given positive integer is divisible by 4</a>, just like the hypothetical Turing machine that I describe in my previous post.</p>

<p>I include <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/turing/testdiv4">a Bash script that tests that implementation</a>. The script inputs every multiple of 4, ranging from 4 to 40, into the Turing machine program. The program passes every test.</p>
