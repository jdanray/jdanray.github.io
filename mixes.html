<p>Sometimes it's easier to solve a problem if you use a mix of data structures. For example, you can easily determine whether a sequence of characters is a palindrome if you use bothÂ <a href="stacks.html">a stack</a> and <a href="queues.html">a queue</a>. Just add the characters of the sequence to each data structure, and then remove a character from each data structure one at a time and compare them. The sequence is a palindrome if and only if the characters are always the same.</p></p>
