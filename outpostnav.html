<p><a href="https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/external/64/6476.pdf">Outpost Navigation</a> is an <a href="https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php">ACM-ICPC</a> problem. I solved it about a month ago, and <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/problems/outpost_navigation.py">my algorithms</a> are up at <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/">my GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I give two algorithms. The first algorithm is basically a Frankenstein of <a href="bfs.html">breadth-first search</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra's algorithm</a>. The second algorithm is a <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/course/cis680/cis680Ch19.html">recursive backtracking algorithm</a> that performs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth-first search</a> through the graph that represents the outposts and roads.</p>

<p>The first algorithm is better. Recursive backtracking enumerates all possible solutions. In contrast, the first solution that breadth-first search finds is guaranteed to be the optimal solution. So, once it finds one solution, it can stop.</p>
