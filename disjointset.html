<p>The disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that represents set partitions.</p>

<p>A set partition of a set S is a collection of disjoint subsets of S whose union is S.</p>

<p>Sets are <em>disjoint</em> if and only if they have no elements in common, and the <em>union</em> of a collection of sets is the set obtained by combining the elements of each set. So, when we partition a set, we put all of its elements into a collection of subsets, making sure that none of the subsets share any elements. For example, the set partitions of {1,2,3} are {{1,2,3}}, {{1},{2},{3}}, {{1},{2,3}}, {{1,2},{3}}, and {{1,3},{2}}.</p>

<p>Again, a disjoint-set data structure lets us efficiently model a set partition on a computer. It has two operations defined on it:</p>

<p>1. <strong>Union</strong>: Replaces two subsets with their union.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Find</strong>: Locates an element's subset.</p>

<p>For this reason, disjoint-set data structures are also called "union-find data structures."</p>
