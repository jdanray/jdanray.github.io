<p>A quine is a computer program that prints its own source code. Writing a quine is not as easy as you might think.</p>

<p>To learn how to write quines, I made use of <a href="http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html">David Madore's discussion of quines</a> and <i>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</i>, by Michael Sipser. However, I prefer Sipser's discussion. I found it to be a lot clearer than Madore's.</p>

<p>Sipser does not talk about computer programs. Instead, he talks about <a href="turing.html">Turing machines</a>. A computer program corresponds to a Turing machine. So, a quine corresponds to a Turing machine that outputs a description of itself.</p>

<p>Let QUINE be a Turing machine that outputs a description of itself. QUINE has two parts, C and D, each of which is itself a Turing machine. C outputs a description of D, and D outputs a description of C. So, QUINE outputs a description of its entire self.</p>

<p>D runs first. D outputs onto its tape a description of C. Refer to that description of C as [C].</p>

<p>Let q(w) be the description of a Turing machine that outputs w. q(w) is a computable function. In fact, given any string w, it is easy to construct a Turing machine P_{w} that outputs w. On any input, P_{w} simply outputs w onto its tape, ignoring the input.</p>

<p>Now, C reads [C] off D's tape. Then C computes q([C]). So, now C has the description of a Turing machine that outputs [C]. But that's D! So, now C can output a description of D.</p>

<p>So, a quine has two parts: the code and the data. The data represents the code. The code uses the data to print the code and the data.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/quine/quine.c">a quine in C</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jdanray/blog-code/blob/master/quine/quine.py">a quine in Python</a>. To verify that the C program is a quine, type the following commands at the terminal:</p>

<p>
gcc -o quine quine.c <br />
diff <(./quine) quine.c
</p>

<p>To verify that the Python program is a quine, type the following command:</p>

<p>diff <(python quine.py) quine.py</p>

<p>You will find in both cases that diff produces no output, which means that there are no differences between the programs' outputs and their source code.</p>
